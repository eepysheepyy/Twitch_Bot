So, hi!
I wanted to globalise this twitch bot I've been modifying over the last few months, and make it readily available for people, as I think it to be a really good addition to streams!

I...honestly don't know how half of this works. So I'm really not the best at explaining everything. Im sorry for that in advance.

But, basically, this uses a combination of TwitchIO, OBS Websockets and Python to create a multi-function/purpose bot that can execute custom chat commands.
You can interact with OBS, get all the info from the twitch side of things, and also have python functionality too. 
It's rather simple at the moment, I know, but it has a lot of potential! I've kept some of the things I use for my own streams private. 

I want to eventually add Twitch Auto-modding to this whole thing, but that can wait for now. 

So what do you need? 
Great Question.

Apparently Python 3.10.14, on a Virtual Environment, with 
(!!and make sure your pip is updated!!)

Twitchio - pip install twitchio

OBSWS_Python - pip install obsws-python

and DeepTranslator pip install deep-translator

You will also likely need a twitch dev bot for certain stuff, i think. I can't really remember lol : https://dev.twitch.tv/console
Im sure you guys may work it out. 
Maybe.

Also, there's the item.py file which can tell you what scene_item_id's are (when selected inside OBS) because theres seemingly no other way to check, and it was pissing me off, so I assume that I can alleviate someone else's pain if someone went looking. 

JUST TO CLARIFY: THIS PROGRAM CAN FIND THE scene_item_id of OBS ITEMS when SELECTED inside OBS, when it's connected to your OBS-Websockets. 

ANYWAYS, I'm the eepysheepyy, and that's my part, you can feel free to check out all my socials and stuff here: https://linktr.ee/eepysheepyy

I hope you all have a BAA-Rilliant Day <33
